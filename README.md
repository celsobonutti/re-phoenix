# Reason Media Devices

Hello! These are basic ReasonML bindings for the [Phoenix JS library](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js/). Right now I'm giving preference to the functions I use in my [webRTC app](https://github.com/celsobonutti/elm-webrtc/), but I'll try my best to cover the whole library.

Types are based in the [TS type definitions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/phoenix/index.d.ts), since the Hex docs seem kinda outdated/confusing.
